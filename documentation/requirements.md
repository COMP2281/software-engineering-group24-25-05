## 1.2 - Project Scope

## 1.3 - System Description

### 1.3.1 System Overview

Shadow Operative is an educational game designed to help learners engage with IBM Skills Build content in an immersive and interactive environment. The game places players in the role of a spy during the Cold War, tasked with retrieving stolen plans for a cutting-edge AI system. Through skill-based challenges and AI-driven adaptive difficulty, players are guided through progressively complex levels that reinforce core IBM Skills Build concepts in a gamified format.

### 1.3.2 Research into Alternative Solutions

In designing Shadow Operative, the team conducted extensive research into comparable games and educational platforms to inform and enhance its structure, mechanics, and learning approach. The following games served as key references, with their unique aspects and usefulness to Shadow Operative outlined below:

- **CounterSpy**: A Cold War-era side-scrolling stealth game, CounterSpy serves as a primary thematic reference for Shadow Operative, offering insight into effective use of stealth elements, setting, and art direction within a Cold War context.
  - Limitation: CounterSpy does not integrate educational content, which limits its application in learning environments. Shadow Operative addresses this by embedding educational challenges into the gameplay.
- **This War of Mine**: This side-scrolling survival game provides a perspective on civilian experiences of war, integrating stealth mechanics and adding depth to our Cold War setting by informing character interactions and emotional undertones.
  - Limitation: The game's heavy emotional themes may not be suitable or relevant for younger learners. Shadow Operative maintains engagement while ensuring content is appropriate for educational purposes.
- **Dishonored 2**: Dishonored 2 inspired our enemy awareness systems, and varied approaches to evasion and takedowns. These features are crucial for building the interactive stealth elements in Shadow Operative.
  - Limitation: The complexity of Dishonored 2's mechanics could overwhelm learners. Our game simplifies these systems to ensure accessibility while maintaining engaging gameplay.
- **Batman: Arkham Asylum**: Recognized for its claustrophobic environments and atmospheric design, Batman: Arkham Asylum offers a model for crafting immersive environments and leveraging tight spaces to build tension.
  - Limitation: The combat focus of Batman: Arkham Asylum is less relevant for our stealth-driven gameplay. Shadow Operative focuses purely on stealth to maintain thematic and educational alignment.
- **Kahoot!**: This gamified quiz platform highlights the power of interactive question-based challenges and adaptive difficulty. It directly influences Shadow Operative's question generation system and difficulty adjustments, with timers and music used to create urgency in an educational context.
  - Limitation: Kahoot!'s approach lacks the narrative and immersive elements we aim to include, which Shadow Operative addresses by integrating learning into a cohesive story-driven experience.

### 1.3.3 Proposed Solution’s Technical Features

Shadow Operative integrates the following key technical features to create a unique, adaptive learning experience:

- **Question Generation**: Relevant IBM Skills Build content will populate various levels, embedding knowledge assessments seamlessly into gameplay scenarios. Questions will adapt in difficulty and context to align with players' progress, enhancing engagement and reinforcing learning objectives.
- **Dynamic Difficulty Adjustment**: AI algorithms will monitor and assess player performance, adjusting challenge levels in real-time. This ensures players are consistently engaged and challenged without being overwhelmed, fostering a tailored learning experience.
- **Boss Interactions**: Key encounters, such as boss battles, act as knowledge assessments, where players demonstrate their understanding of core Skills Build concepts in a high-stakes, interactive format that reinforces learning.
- **Stealth Mechanics**: Inspired by CounterSpy and Dishonored 2, Shadow Operative incorporates stealth elements like sneaking, cover mechanics, and enemy awareness to create a tense, immersive experience that complements the game's educational content, keeping the user engaged.

### 1.3.4 Integration Considerations

Shadow Operative is designed as a standalone educational game; however, it is making use of IBM’s AI technology, Granite, allowing the user to make the experience adpative to them, focusing more on their usecase of the system.

# 2 - Solution Requirements

## 2.1 Requirements Elicitation

To gain a thorough understanding of the client’s needs, our team reached out via email on 15/10/24, aiming to address specific concerns about feature integration, gameplay mechanics, and AI-driven educational content. The client responded on 17/10/24, clarifying the project’s focus on seamlessly incorporating IBM Skills Build content (including AI, Cybersecurity, and Data Analytics) into the gameplay. This exchange allowed us to refine the project scope, confirm the inclusion of adaptive learning through AI algorithms, and remove features identified as redundant. These insights also guided us in structuring team roles based on each member’s strengths and development areas.

**Challenges Encountered**

Our initial difficulty was organizing our first meeting with the client due to conflicting schedules among team members. This caused a delay in setting up a direct conversation, which impacted our early progress. Additionally, one of our team members was unavailable for a few weeks due to being away, which further complicated scheduling and resource allocation. Despite these obstacles, the team coordinated through asynchronous communication and adjusted roles temporarily to maintain momentum.

Following this, we held an internal meeting to discuss our objectives in depth and to identify how each member’s skills could contribute to creating a compelling, interactive experience that aligns with CounterSpy’s Cold War-inspired, side-scrolling stealth gameplay. This meeting helped us generate additional questions for the client regarding elements such as how best to implement game mechanics that motivate players to learn and progress through adaptive, question-based challenges. We also explored design inspirations, focusing on essential aspects like gameplay mechanics, Cold War-era visual style, and strategies to maintain a consistent thematic experience. During this meeting, we reached a consensus that the card feature did not align with the game’s objectives, which we then proposed for removal in a follow-up email. The client agreed with this decision.

In our first client meeting on 06/11/24, we discussed key project concerns and shared a preliminary MoSCoW prioritization to confirm alignment with the client’s goals. The client agreed that the educational component should be the top priority, as the primary aim is to promote IBM Skills Build badges in a more engaging way than current text-based modules. To address this, we collaboratively designed a core game mechanic: when a player is spotted by a robotic guard, they must answer a multiple-choice question to proceed.

To refine our requirements into behavioral specifications, we used Gherkin language. For example, we created scenarios detailing how the game would present challenges, adjust difficulty dynamically, and integrate IBM Skills Build content seamlessly. This method allowed us to concisely capture the desired system behavior and align it with the client’s educational objectives. This allowed us to create user stories that detailed the player’s journey through the game, from initial engagement to mastery of key concepts, ensuring that our requirements were user-focused and aligned with the client’s vision.

**Requirement Validation**

To ensure that our refined requirements aligned accurately with the client’s needs, we sent a confirmation email summarizing key decisions and requested feedback. The client’s positive response affirmed our direction. We also planned a follow-up meeting to further validate our approach and address any remaining questions, ensuring continuous alignment with the client’s educational goals.

Our team then met to discuss the client’s feedback and refine our understanding of the project’s requirements. We identified key features, such as question generation, dynamic difficulty adjustment, and boss interactions, that would enhance the game’s educational value and align with the client’s objectives.

## 2.2 - Behavioural Requirements

# 3 - Project Management

## 3.1 - Risks and Issues

When developing a large software project with a team, it is important to be
aware of the potential risks and issues that may arise, and to have plans in
place to mitigate them. Issues may arise from a variety of sources, including
the group itself, the client, the software produced or even the available
hardware.

### 3.1.1 Group Risks

One of the most significant risks when working in a team is that of team members
not working together effectively. This may result from differing levels of
knowledge, different problem solving styles, alternate programming styles and
more. Fortunately, this can be mitigated by creating comprehensive plans for the
project and ensuring everyone is assigned roles that suit their strengths. If
the team cannot work together effectively, it can become difficult to develop a
cohesive product, and may lead to more bugs and issues down the line.

$$
\begin{aligned}
  &\text{Consequence}=4 \\
  &\text{Likelihood}=2 \\
  &\text{Risk}=4\times2=8 \implies {\color{orange}\text{High}}
\end{aligned}
$$

Uneven workloads, despite being unfair on those doing more work, can lead to
some members not understanding the current state of the project or how new
features should be implemented. This can make it hard to continue contributing
to the project, resulting in even lower productivity, slower development and a
less complete product. To mitigate this risk, it is important to ensure that
everyone is assigned tasks before the project starts, and that regular meetings
are held to discuss progress and potential task shifts.

$$
\begin{aligned}
  &\text{Consequence}=3 \\
  &\text{Likelihood}=3 \\
  &\text{Risk}=4\times2=9 \implies {\color{orange}\text{High}}
\end{aligned}
$$

### 3.1.2 Client Risks

Another area of concern is the potential for the client to provide unrealistic,
unreasonable or poorly defined requirements. If this happens, it can extremely
difficult to produce a cohesive plan and deliver a product that meets the
client's expectations. To mitigate such a risk, it is important to have multiple
meetings with the client at regular intervals, discussing the project's current
state, planned development and any changes the client may request. This way, the
client can provide feedback and desired alterations before they are too deeply
embedded in the project, or even before they are implemented.

$$
\begin{aligned}
  &\text{Consequence}=3 \\
  &\text{Likelihood}=2 \\
  &\text{Risk}=3\times2=6 \implies {\color{orange}\text{Moderate}}
\end{aligned}
$$

Another potential risk is that the client may be slow to respond, or completely
unresponsive. In this case, it can be difficult to get started on the project
because the requirements are not clearly defined, and it is difficult to provide
a product that meets their expectations, since the feedback is not beign
given in a timely manner. To mitigate this risk, it is important to have a clear
communication plan with set dates and deadlines for features, meetings and
general updates. It is also especially important to develop a well-written
codebase which can be easily modified and maintained.

$$
\begin{aligned}
  &\text{Consequence}=2 \\
  &\text{Likelihood}=1 \\
  &\text{Risk}=2\times1=2 \implies {\color{orange}\text{Low}}
\end{aligned}
$$

### 3.1.3 Software Development Methodology Risks

Large codebases require strict adherence to project-defined standards, as
otherwise it can become difficult for team members to work on other parts of the
project. Additionally, the code must be highly modular, since the code developed
by one team member must be able to interact with the code developed by others,
regardless of the implementation details. Furthermore, it is useful to have
clean, readable code, with comments in areas that are not obvious. This ensures
that code can still be understood months after it was first written, which may
be necessary for debugging and maintenance purposes.

$$
\begin{aligned}
  &\text{Consequence}=4 \\
  &\text{Likelihood}=4 \\
  &\text{Risk}=4\times4=16 \implies {\color{orange}\text{Extreme}}
\end{aligned}
$$

### 3.1.4 AI Risks

AI is a very powerful tool, but can be dangerous if not used correctly. LLMs in
particular can be very useful and produce high quality results, but are also
susceptible to biases and may produce inaccurate or inappropriate results.
Fortunately, much research has been conducted in this area, and popular LLMs are
'aligned' with human values, and are highly unlikely to produce offensive
suggestions. Unfortunately, incorrect results are still quite common.

$$
\begin{aligned}
  &\text{Consequence}=5 \\
  &\text{Likelihood}=1 \\
  &\text{Risk}=5\times1=5 \implies {\color{orange}\text{Moderate}}
\end{aligned}
$$

## 3.2 - Development Approach

### 3.2.1 - Incremental Model

* The Incremental Model divides the project into smaller, manageable portions (increments). Each increment represents a subset of the full game functionality.

* With each increment, you develop a part of the game and deliver it. Once that part is functional, you can move on to the next one.

* Each new increment builds upon the previous one, allowing you to add new features, mechanics, or puzzle elements step by step.

### 3.2.2 - In the context of the project

1. Gradual Progress: Since our game includes different mechanics (e.g., running, jumping, sliding), puzzles, and IBM skill badge questions, we could develop one feature at a time. For example, we can first build core mechanics, then puzzles, and then implement the card system for enhancing IBM skills.

2. Feedback after Each Increment: After each partial development done , we can test it and get the feedback. This ensures that individual components work as intended before combining them into the final game.

3. Risk Management: The Incremental Model is useful when different features have varying complexities. It helps manage risk by addressing simpler features first and more complex ones later, ensuring a steady development pace.

4. Flexibility: when we developing the program , client might change the requirement or we need to adjust the direction or the function of our project , while incremental model plays a very important role to help us prevent from deleting a large number of previous documents

5. Player engagement: incremental model means we can republic our game in advance even thought we haven't finished the whole game , we can get the feedback from the client and vary our direction or adjust our code base on the feedback immediately .

6. Suitable for small team : Since we are a small which only has 7 people , the incremental model help us allocate the work more efficacy , we only need to focus on the specific content each time , and makes all the people engaged , also can clearly keep tracking work progress.

7. Simplicity: The incremental model provides straightforward, predictable development process, also offers a structured, step-by-step approach with clear deliverables at each stage.

## 3.3 - Project Schedule

### 3.3.1 - Gantt Chart

<p align="center">
    <img src="./images/gantt-chart.png">
</p>

### 3.3.2 - Art / Vision Design

Due to **Unity** offering an open source template that closely
matches the client's vision of the final game we have decided to
have an extended period of planning the aspects of the game such as:

Game mechanics which include: stealth mechanics, boss fights (as per request of the client),
integration of IBM's Granite AI into the project which would make game feel more "alive" as
it adapts to the player's behaviour, and lastly the educational part of the game
which integrates content from IBM's SkillsBuild.

Careful thought has to go to the game's art direction, while the client
specified CounterSpy as an inspiration he has allowed us to have artistic liberty
which allows us to choose a style that could mesh together all of the client's
requests.

### 3.3.3 - RAG Analysis and the Questions Bank

As mentioned in `3.3.1` the game has an educational side and the client
has tasked us with taking questions from the IBM SkillsBuild courses
and integrating them into the game.

This is one of the first things that need to be completed in order
to have a clear vision over how the game should take shape.

### 3.3.4 - C# / Unity Acquaintance

Not all of our team is well acquainted with the `C#` / `Unity` environment,
because of this we have planned a long lasting period (until the end of Christmas
Vacation) where we can familiarize ourselves with the toolset.

For the team members who already have experience, there is a period
dedicated to refactoring the Unity template in order to better suit our needs.

### 3.3.5 - Game Mechanics Implementation and Test Plan

The Game Mechanics Implementation and preparation of the Test Plan
will run in parallel, as we develop the game incrementally we
can identify ways of testing our solution.

Key mechanics that have to be implemented and polished are:

1) Basic movement: movement should feel fluid, responsive, must include
crouching (stealth).

2) Stealth Mechanics: "light" and "dark" zones where the AI of
the laboratory can either see you or not, if detected sends enemies

3) The environment reacting to the player: by using IBM's Granite AI
we hope to achieve enemies/bosses that react dynamically to the player;
and even in the case of the educational side make the questions harder/easier
depending on the success rate of the player.

### 3.3.6 - Level Design and IBM Education Integration

Once we have a solid foundation of game mechanics we expect
to be able to create a plausible environment around said mechanics.

We plan on having `3` different stages due to how the **Questions Bank**
is based off of 3 different IBM SkillsBuild courses.

Each stage would teach the player different game mechanics and introduce
new concepts.

### 3.3.7 - Technical Report and Product Presentation

They will start to run in parallel once we are at the end of the development
cycle with the **Game Mechanics Implementation**

### 3.3.8 - Key Deadlines

* `2024-11-28`: Finish client RAG Analysis and Questions Bank
* `2024-03-21`: Finish all game deadlines (mechanics, level design, IBM integration)
